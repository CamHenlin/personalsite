						Working for the ESA*, many parents often ask me, "Should I allow my children to play video games?" For many, there is a constant fear that their children may
						become socially withdrawn from the outside world if they spend time playing video games.<br>
						Today, I am very pleased to announce that a recently concluded
						<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2008/09/16/teens-video-games-and-civics/">independent study</a> conducted by
						<a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/">the Pew Research Center</a> indicates that children may receive numerous
						social and educational benefits thanks to video games.
						<br><br>
						"What types of social benefits can the inherently anti-social behavior of sitting in front of an LCD have to offer?" you might ask.
						That actually turns out to be pretty straight forward today. Not only do 76% of kids game together, in person, but many games are now playable online as well.
						Because of this, 50% of teenage gamers are now playing games together online as a part of a guild or group of other players,
						a fantastic way to interact as part of a group that would otherwise not be possible without video games. Reading a book might not be able to get you that.
						<br><br>
						Gaming is also fast becoming a major educator outside of the traditional classroom environment as well. Pew reports that
						many teenagers were able to learn pick up on a <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2008/09/16/part-1-3-the-social-nature-of-teen-video-game-play/#more-than-one-in-three-teens-has-played-a-video-game-for-school">
						variety of topics through games like Oregon Trail and Lemonade Stand</a>.
						<br><br>
						So, parents, it turns out that there are a few good reasons for your kids to spend some time playing video games. Who knows, maybe you can
						find some video games that you can play together, socialize with your children some more, and learning something new yourselves.
